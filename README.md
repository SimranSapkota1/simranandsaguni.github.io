# Food and Beverage Sales Analysis through Power BI
The following blog showcases the data visualization of sales dataset for foods and beverages industry throughout the Quarter of the year 2019. The Power BI project was created by Saguni Thapa Magar and Simran Sapkota as a pair project.
### Overview of the Sales Data
The Sales data for foods and beverages comprises information including Quantity, Product category, Product Group, Salesperson, etc. The key objective of this visualization is to understand how the revenue model and sales order for food and beverages are affected by factors such as channel, Product Category, Product Group, salesperson, etc. throughout the month and Quarter. 

The dataset is collected from Kaggle with the objective of visualizing the data.

#### The following are the work performed for this dataset

#### i.) Model Relationship Management:

The model relationship in powerbi shows how one data is structured and related to other data. The dataset contains one to one relationship as the information in the dataset only appears once. Therefore, the first step we followed after cleaning the data is creating a model view of one table with other table sheets within the given dataset frame.



#### ii.) Implementation of Dax Formulas:

DAX formulas include functions, operators, and values to perform advanced calculations and queries on data in related tables and columns in tabular data models. We created a Sales Amount column, and from the new measure tool in table view through Formula Sales Amount = Sheet1[Quantity]* Sheet1[UnitPrice]. This created a total Sales Amount. This helped in the proper visualization and interpretation of the given data in the dashboard.

### Performance Measurement

To measure the performance of the data, we used various tools like Bar Charts, Clustered Bar Charts, Donut Charts, Column Charts, Cards, etc., allowing us to interpret and understand the dataset information easily. These tools proved helpful for profitability measurement, tracking key performance indicators of Sales revenue, average order per product, customer acquisition and retention, and loss throughout the Quarters and months. Similarly, we can measure sales revenue or customer purchases on the basis of region, product categories, and varieties to identify high-profit areas so that maximum resources can be used for customer retention.

#### Managerial Insights
The analysis of the data reveals seasonal trends in beverage and food revenue. Beverage sales peak in colder months, while food sales peak in warmer months. Salesperson performance and product category dominance were also identified. These findings suggest strategic adjustments:

- Seasonality: Align marketing efforts with peak sales seasons for each category (beverages - colder months, food - warmer months).
- Sales Force: To motivate the sales team, recognize and incentivize top performers (K. Araujo - beverages, C. Ferreira - food).
- Product Mix: Analyze the top-selling products (e.g., hard liquor in beverages, wheat flour in food) and explore opportunities for range expansion or complementary product promotion.
- Distribution Channels: Optimize resource allocation across channels (retail vs. distributors) based on their contribution to revenue for each product category, as seen in the analysis of retail channels for both food and drinks. 

This data-driven approach can enhance profitability by maximizing sales opportunities and optimizing resource allocation.
